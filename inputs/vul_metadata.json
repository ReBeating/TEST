This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the \"gap\" between the stack and the binary."

This was introduced in kernel version 4.19 by commit d1d04ef (\"ovl: stack file ops\"). This was fixed in kernel version 5.8 by commits 56230d9 (\"ovl: verify permissions in ovl_path_open()\"), 48bd024 (\"ovl: switch to mounter creds in readdir\") and 05acefb (\"ovl: check permission to open real file\"). Additionally, commits 130fdbc (\"ovl: pass correct flags for opening real directory\") and 292f902 (\"ovl: call secutiry hook in ovl_real_ioctl()\") in kernel 5.8 might also be desired or necessary. These additional commits introduced a regression in overlay mounts within user namespaces which prevented access to files with ownership outside of the user namespace. This regression was mitigated by subsequent commit b6650da (\"ovl: do not fail because of O_NOATIMEi\") in kernel 5.11."

In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery.

As part of that patch,\nsizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so\nthe driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous\ntransactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.\n\nUnfortunately, on the \"free\" side, the accounting of async_free_space\ndid not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of\nasync_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or\nless.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue\nhas gone undetected for several years.\n\nThe fix is to use \"buffer_size\" (the allocated buffer size) instead of\n\"size\" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space\nduring the free operation. These are the same except for this\ncorner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes."

Thus when dwc->gadget is freed,\nthe first dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer and\nlikewise for the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list.\nThe dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a\nuse-after-free when it calls list_del().\n\nThis was caught by enabling KASAN and performing a driver unbind.\nThe recent commit 568262bf5492 (\"usb: dwc3: core: Add shutdown\ncallback for dwc3\") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.\n\nThere are a few possibilities to fix this.  One could be to perform\na list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it from\nthe rest of the dwc3_ep chain.\n\nAnother approach is what this patch does, by splitting up the\nusb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate \"del\" and \"put\"\ncomponents.  This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be\ncalled before the gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget()."

When this happens we deadlock, since\nflushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotree\nand the range was already locked at the very beginning of the clone\noperation, before attempting to start the transaction.\n\nWhen this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:\n\n  [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9   state:D stack:    0 pid:  225 ppid:     2 flags:0x00004000\n  [72747.556268] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-btrfs-1142)\n  [72747.556271] Call Trace:\n  [72747.556273]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.556277]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.556279]  io_schedule+0x12/0x40\n  [72747.556284]  __lock_page+0x13c/0x280\n  [72747.556287]  ? generic_file_readonly_mmap+0x70/0x70\n  [72747.556325]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x22a/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556331]  ? __set_page_dirty_nobuffers+0xe7/0x160\n  [72747.556358]  ? set_extent_buffer_dirty+0x5e/0x80 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556362]  ? update_group_capacity+0x25/0x210\n  [72747.556366]  ? cpumask_next_and+0x1a/0x20\n  [72747.556391]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556394]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.556398]  __writeback_single_inode+0x39/0x2a0\n  [72747.556403]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x1ea/0x440\n  [72747.556407]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x5f/0xc0\n  [72747.556410]  wb_writeback+0x235/0x2b0\n  [72747.556414]  ? get_nr_inodes+0x35/0x50\n  [72747.556417]  wb_workfn+0x354/0x490\n  [72747.556420]  ? newidle_balance+0x2c5/0x3e0\n  [72747.556424]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.556426]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.556429]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.556432]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.556435]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.556438]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.566958] Workqueue: btrfs-flush_delalloc btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]\n  [72747.566961] Call Trace:\n  [72747.566964]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.566968]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.566970]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.566995]  wait_extent_bit.constprop.68+0x13b/0x1c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.566999]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567024]  lock_extent_bits+0x37/0x90 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567047]  btrfs_invalidatepage+0x299/0x2c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567051]  ? find_get_pages_range_tag+0x2cd/0x380\n  [72747.567076]  __extent_writepage+0x203/0x320 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567102]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x2bb/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567106]  ? update_load_avg+0x7e/0x5f0\n  [72747.567109]  ? enqueue_entity+0xf4/0x6f0\n  [72747.567134]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567137]  ? enqueue_task_fair+0x93/0x6f0\n  [72747.567140]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.567144]  __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xc7/0x100\n  [72747.567167]  btrfs_run_delalloc_work+0x17/0x40 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567195]  btrfs_work_helper+0xc2/0x300 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567200]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.567202]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.567205]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.567208]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.567211]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567214]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.569686] task:fsstress        state:D stack:    \n---truncated---"

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: prevent corruption in shrinking truncate\n\nI believe there are some issues introduced by commit 31651c607151\n(\"hfsplus: avoid deadlock on file truncation\")\n\nHFS+ has extent records which always contains 8 extents.  In case the\nfirst extent record in catalog file gets full, new ones are allocated from\nextents overflow file.\n\nIn case shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which\nlocates in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was\nchanged so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.\n\nRight action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new size\ninside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then check if\nthe whole extent record should be removed.  However since the guard\n(blk_cnt > start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(), this has\nunfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is removed\nunconditionally.\n\nTo reproduce this issue, create a file which has at least 10 extents, and\nthen perform shrinking truncate into middle of the last extent record, so\nthat the number of remaining extents is not under or divisible by 8.  This\ncauses the last extent record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of\ntruncating into middle of it.  Thus this causes corruption, and lost data.\n\nFix for this is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the\nstart of this extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent\nrecord.  However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous\nplace since we're dropping ->tree_lock and it can cause a race condition\nand the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting the node data.\n\nAnother issue is related to this one.  When entering into the block\n(blk_cnt > start) we are not holding the ->tree_lock.  We break out from\nthe loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit() does unlock it.  Not\nsure if it's possible for someone else to take the lock under our feet,\nbut it can cause hard to debug errors and premature unlocking.  Even if\nthere's no real risk of it, the locking should still always be kept in\nbalance.  Thus taking the lock now just before the check."

The new\nAPIs introduce a struct obj_cgroup to charge slab objects.  It prevents\nlong-living objects from pinning the original memory cgroup in the\nmemory.  But there are still some corner objects (e.g.  allocations\nlarger than order-1 page on SLUB) which are not charged with the new\nAPIs.  Those objects (include the pages which are allocated from buddy\nallocator directly) are charged as kmem pages which still hold a\nreference to the memory cgroup.\n\nE.g.  We know that the kernel stack is charged as kmem pages because the\nsize of the kernel stack can be greater than 2 pages (e.g.  16KB on\nx86_64 or arm64).  If we create a thread (suppose the thread stack is\ncharged to memory cgroup A) and then move it from memory cgroup A to\nmemory cgroup B.  Because the kernel stack of the thread hold a\nreference to the memory cgroup A.  The thread can pin the memory cgroup\nA in the memory even if we remove the cgroup A.  If we want to see this\nscenario by using the following script.  We can see that the system has\nadded 500 dying cgroups (This is not a real world issue, just a script\nto show that the large kmallocs are charged as kmem pages which can pin\nthe memory cgroup in the memory).\n\n\t#!/bin/bash\n\n\tcat /proc/cgroups | grep memory\n\n\tcd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory\n\techo 1 > memory.move_charge_at_immigrate\n\n\tfor i in range{1..500}\n\tdo\n\t\tmkdir kmem_test\n\t\techo $$ > kmem_test/cgroup.procs\n\t\tsleep 3600 &\n\t\techo $$ > cgroup.procs\n\t\techo `cat kmem_test/cgroup.procs` > cgroup.procs\n\t\trmdir kmem_test\n\tdone\n\n\tcat /proc/cgroups | grep memory\n\nThis patchset aims to make those kmem pages to drop the reference to\nmemory cgroup by using the APIs of obj_cgroup.  Finally, we can see that\nthe number of the dying cgroups will not increase if we run the above test\nscript.\n\nThis patch (of 7):\n\nThe rcu_read_lock/unlock only can guarantee that the memcg will not be\nfreed, but it cannot guarantee the success of css_get (which is in the\nrefill_stock when cached memcg changed) to memcg.\n\n  rcu_read_lock()\n  memcg = obj_cgroup_memcg(old)\n  __memcg_kmem_uncharge(memcg)\n      refill_stock(memcg)\n          if (stock->cached != memcg)\n              // css_get can change the ref counter from 0 back to 1.\n              css_get(&memcg->css)\n  rcu_read_unlock()\n\nThis fix is very like the commit:\n\n  eefbfa7fd678 (\"mm: memcg/slab: fix use after free in obj_cgroup_charge\")\n\nFix this by holding a reference to the memcg which is passed to the\n__memcg_kmem_uncharge() before calling __memcg_kmem_uncharge()."

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, lockdown, audit: Fix buggy SELinux lockdown permission checks\n\nCommit 59438b46471a (\"security,lockdown,selinux: implement SELinux lockdown\")\nadded an implementation of the locked_down LSM hook to SELinux, with the aim\nto restrict which domains are allowed to perform operations that would breach\nlockdown. This is indirectly also getting audit subsystem involved to report\nevents. The latter is problematic, as reported by Ondrej and Serhei, since it\ncan bring down the whole system via audit:\n\n  1) The audit events that are triggered due to calls to security_locked_down()\n     can OOM kill a machine, see below details [0].\n\n  2) It also seems to be causing a deadlock via avc_has_perm()/slow_avc_audit()\n     when trying to wake up kauditd, for example, when using trace_sched_switch()\n     tracepoint, see details in [1]. Triggering this was not via some hypothetical\n     corner case, but with existing tools like runqlat & runqslower from bcc, for\n     example, which make use of this tracepoint. Rough call sequence goes like:\n\n     rq_lock(rq) -> -------------------------+\n       trace_sched_switch() ->               |\n         bpf_prog_xyz() ->                   +-> deadlock\n           selinux_lockdown() ->             |\n             audit_log_end() ->              |\n               wake_up_interruptible() ->    |\n                 try_to_wake_up() ->         |\n                   rq_lock(rq) --------------+\n\nWhat's worse is that the intention of 59438b46471a to further restrict lockdown\nsettings for specific applications in respect to the global lockdown policy is\ncompletely broken for BPF. The SELinux policy rule for the current lockdown check\nlooks something like this:\n\n  allow <who> <who> : lockdown { <reason> };\n\nHowever, this doesn't match with the 'current' task where the security_locked_down()\nis executed, example: httpd does a syscall. There is a tracing program attached\nto the syscall which triggers a BPF program to run, which ends up doing a\nbpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}() helper call. The selinux_lockdown() hook does\nthe permission check against 'current', that is, httpd in this example. httpd\nhas literally zero relation to this tracing program, and it would be nonsensical\nhaving to write an SELinux policy rule against httpd to let the tracing helper\npass. The policy in this case needs to be against the entity that is installing\nthe BPF program. For example, if bpftrace would generate a histogram of syscall\ncounts by user space application:\n\n  bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'\n\nbpftrace would then go and generate a BPF program from this internally. One way\nof doing it [for the sake of the example] could be to call bpf_get_current_task()\nhelper and then access current->comm via one of bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}()\nhelpers. So the program itself has nothing to do with httpd or any other random\napp doing a syscall here. The BPF program _explicitly initiated_ the lockdown\ncheck. The allow/deny policy belongs in the context of bpftrace: meaning, you\nwant to grant bpftrace access to use these helpers, but other tracers on the\nsystem like my_random_tracer _not_.\n\nTherefore fix all three issues at the same time by taking a completely different\napproach for the security_locked_down() hook, that is, move the check into the\nprogram verification phase where we actually retrieve the BPF func proto. This\nalso reliably gets the task (current) that is trying to install the BPF tracing\nprogram, e.g. bpftrace/bcc/perf/systemtap/etc, and it also fixes the OOM since\nwe're moving this out of the BPF helper's fast-path which can be called several\nmillions of times per second.\n\nThe check is then also in line with other security_locked_down() hooks in the\nsystem where the enforcement is performed at open/load time, for example,\nopen_kcore() for /proc/kcore access or module_sig_check() for module signatures\njust to pick f\n---truncated---"

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/tls: Fix use-after-free after the TLS device goes down and up\n\nWhen a netdev with active TLS offload goes down, tls_device_down is\ncalled to stop the offload and tear down the TLS context. However, the\nsocket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which is now\ndeallocated. If a netdev goes up, while the connection is still active,\nand the data flow resumes after a number of TCP retransmissions, it will\nlead to a use-after-free of the TLS context.\n\nThis commit addresses this bug by keeping the context alive until its\nnormal destruction, and implements the necessary fallbacks, so that the\nconnection can resume in software (non-offloaded) kTLS mode.\n\nOn the TX side tls_sw_fallback is used to encrypt all packets. The RX\nside already has all the necessary fallbacks, because receiving\nnon-decrypted packets is supported. The thing needed on the RX side is\nto block resync requests, which are normally produced after receiving\nnon-decrypted packets.\n\nThe necessary synchronization is implemented for a graceful teardown:\nfirst the fallbacks are deployed, then the driver resources are released\n(it used to be possible to have a tls_dev_resync after tls_dev_del).\n\nA new flag called TLS_RX_DEV_DEGRADED is added to indicate the fallback\nmode. It's used to skip the RX resync logic completely, as it becomes\nuseless, and some objects may be released (for example, resync_async,\nwhich is allocated and freed by the driver)."

In the case\nof a block transaction, this can result in an out-of-range memory\naccess.\n\nThis condition was reproduced several times by syzbot:\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=ed71512d469895b5b34e\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=8c8dedc0ba9e03f6c79e\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=c8ff0b6d6c73d81b610e\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=33f6c360821c399d69eb\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=be15dc0b1933f04b043a\nhttps://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=b4d3fd1dfd53e90afd79\n\nSo disable interrupts while trying to reset the bus.

The commit 1130b499b4a7\n(\"scsi: target: tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper\") triggered the\nsymptom. The commit modified work queue to handle commands and changed\n'current->nr_cpu_allowed' at smp_processor_id() call.\n\nThe message was also observed at system shutdown when TCMU devices were not\ncleaned up [2]. The function smp_processor_id() was called in SCSI host\nwork queue for abort handling, and triggered the BUG message. This symptom\nwas observed regardless of the commit 1130b499b4a7 (\"scsi: target:\ntcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper\").\n\nTo avoid the preemptible code check at smp_processor_id(), get CPU ID with\nraw_smp_processor_id() instead. The CPU ID is used for performance\nimprovement then thread move to other CPU will not affect the code.\n\n[1]\n\n[   56.468103] run blktests block/005 at 2021-05-12 14:16:38\n[   57.369473] check_preemption_disabled: 85 callbacks suppressed\n[   57.369480] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: fio/1511\n[   57.369506] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: fio/1510\n[   57.369512] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: fio/1506\n[   57.369552] caller is __target_init_cmd+0x157/0x170 [target_core_mod]\n[   57.369606] CPU: 4 PID: 1506 Comm: fio Not tainted 5.13.0-rc1+ #34\n[   57.369613] Hardware name: System manufacturer System Product Name/PRIME Z270-A, BIOS 1302 03/15/2018\n[   57.369617] Call Trace:\n[   57.369621] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: fio/1507\n[   57.369628]  dump_stack+0x6d/0x89\n[   57.369642]  check_preemption_disabled+0xc8/0xd0\n[   57.369628] caller is __target_init_cmd+0x157/0x170 [target_core_mod]\n[   57.369655]  __target_init_cmd+0x157/0x170 [target_core_mod]\n[   57.369695]  target_init_cmd+0x76/0x90 [target_core_mod]\n[   57.369732]  tcm_loop_queuecommand+0x109/0x210 [tcm_loop]\n[   57.369744]  scsi_queue_rq+0x38e/0xc40\n[   57.369761]  __blk_mq_try_issue_directly+0x109/0x1c0\n[   57.369779]  blk_mq_try_issue_directly+0x43/0x90\n[   57.369790]  blk_mq_submit_bio+0x4e5/0x5d0\n[   57.369812]  submit_bio_noacct+0x46e/0x4e0\n[   57.369830]  __blkdev_direct_IO_simple+0x1a3/0x2d0\n[   57.369859]  ? set_init_blocksize.isra.0+0x60/0x60\n[   57.369880]  generic_file_read_iter+0x89/0x160\n[   57.369898]  blkdev_read_iter+0x44/0x60\n[   57.369906]  new_sync_read+0x102/0x170\n[   57.369929]  vfs_read+0xd4/0x160\n[   57.369941]  __x64_sys_pread64+0x6e/0xa0\n[   57.369946]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x79/0x100\n[   57.369958]  do_syscall_64+0x3a/0x70\n[   57.369965]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n[   57.369973] RIP: 0033:0x7f7ed4c1399f\n[   57.369979] Code: 08 89 3c 24 48 89 4c 24 18 e8 7d f3 ff ff 4c 8b 54 24 18 48 8b 54 24 10 41 89 c0 48 8b 74 24 08 8b 3c 24 b8 11 00 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 31 44 89 c7 48 89 04 24 e8 cd f3 ff ff 48 8b\n[   57.369983] RSP: 002b:00007ffd7918c580 EFLAGS: 00000293 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000011\n[   57.369990] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00000000015b4540 RCX: 00007f7ed4c1399f\n[   57.369993] RDX: 0000000000001000 RSI: 00000000015de000 RDI: 0000000000000009\n[   57.369996] RBP: 00000000015b4540 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000001\n[   57.369999] R10: 0000000000e5c000 R11: 0000000000000293 R12: 00007f7eb5269a70\n[   57.370002] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000001000 R15: 00000000015b4568\n[   57.370031] CPU: 7 PID: 1507 Comm: fio Not tainted 5.13.0-rc1+ #34\n[   57.370036] Hardware name: System manufacturer System Product Name/PRIME Z270-A, BIOS 1302 03/15/2018\n[   57.370039] Call Trace:\n[   57.370045]  dump_stack+0x6d/0x89\n[   57.370056]  ch\n---truncated---"

The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects."

Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\n\n\tif (!hidpp->protocol_major) {\n\t\thidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\n\t\thidpp->protocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\n\t}\n\nWe can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output\nattached to rhbz#2227968:\n\n[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n\nTesting with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads\ntake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong\nthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:\n\n2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\n\n\tif (hidpp->name == hdev->name) {\n\t\t...\n\t\thidpp->name = new_name;\n\t}\n\n3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):\n\nhidpp_initialize_battery()\n{\n        if (hidpp->battery.ps)\n                return 0;\n\n\tprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\n\n\thidpp->battery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp->battery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);\n}\n\n4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\n\n\tif (hidpp->delayed_input)\n\t\treturn;\n\n\thidpp->delayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);\n\nThe really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\n\n\thidpp->battery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp->battery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);\n\n\t...\n\n\thidpp->battery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp->battery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);\n\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\n\nNotice how:\n\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2. The hidpp->battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies\n3. hidpp->battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second\n   devm_kmemdup()\n\nThis causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:\n1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered\n2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,\n   hidpp->battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory\n3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,\n   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes\n   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data\n4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp->battery.desc.properties which\n   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:\n\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  \n---truncated---"

This can happen under some\ncircumstances, such as splicing into an L2TP socket.\n\nThe symptom observed is a warning in __ip6_append_data():\n\n    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5042 at net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800 __ip6_append_data.isra.0+0x1be8/0x47f0 net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800\n\nthat occurs when MSG_SPLICE_PAGES is used to append more data to an already\npartially occupied skbuff.  The warning occurs when 'copy' is larger than\nthe amount of data in the message iterator.  This is because the requested\nlength includes the transport header length when it shouldn't.  This can be\ntriggered by, for example:\n\n        sfd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_L2TP);\n        bind(sfd, ...); // ::1\n        connect(sfd, ...); // ::1 port 7\n        send(sfd, buffer, 4100, MSG_MORE);\n        sendfile(sfd, dfd, NULL, 1024);\n\nFix this by only adding transhdrlen into the length if the write queue is\nempty in l2tp_ip6_sendmsg(), analogously to how UDP does things.\n\nl2tp_ip_sendmsg() looks like it won't suffer from this problem as it builds\nthe UDP packet itself."

The purpose of the function is to update\nthe guest's AP configuration by filtering the matrix of adapters and\ndomains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain is assigned, only\nthe APQNs associated with the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new\ndomain are inspected. If an APQN does not reference a queue device bound to\nthe vfio_ap device driver, then it's APID will be filtered from the mdev's\nmatrix when updating the guest's AP configuration.\n\nInspecting only the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain will\nresult in passing AP queues through to a guest that are not bound to the\nvfio_ap device driver under certain circumstances. Consider the following:\n\nguest's AP configuration (all also assigned to the mdev's matrix):\n14.0004\n14.0005\n14.0006\n16.0004\n16.0005\n16.0006\n\nunassign domain 4\nunbind queue 16.0005\nassign domain 4\n\nWhen domain 4 is re-assigned, since only domain 4 will be inspected, the\nAPQNs that will be examined will be:\n14.0004\n16.0004\n\nSince both of those APQNs reference queue devices that are bound to the\nvfio_ap device driver, nothing will get filtered from the mdev's matrix\nwhen updating the guest's AP configuration. Consequently, queue 16.0005\nwill get passed through despite not being bound to the driver. This\nviolates the linux device model requirement that a guest shall only be\ngiven access to devices bound to the device driver facilitating their\npass-through.\n\nTo resolve this problem, every adapter and domain assigned to the mdev will\nbe inspected when filtering the mdev's matrix."

When the driver goes into a fw_down cycle it will\nset the PDSC_S_FW_DEAD bit and then wait for the adminq_refcnt\nto hit 1. Setting the PDSC_S_FW_DEAD before waiting will prevent\nany further adminq_refcnt increments. Waiting for the\nadminq_refcnt to hit 1 allows for any current users of the adminq\nto finish before the driver frees the adminq. Once the\nadminq_refcnt hits 1 the driver clears the refcnt to signify that\nthe adminq is deleted and cannot be used. On the fw_up cycle the\ndriver will once again initialize the adminq_refcnt to 1 allowing\nthe adminq to be used again."

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix RELEASE_LOCKOWNER\n\nThe test on so_count in nfsd4_release_lockowner() is nonsense and\nharmful.  Revert to using check_for_locks(), changing that to not sleep.\n\nFirst: harmful.\nAs is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4_release_lockowner(), the\ntest on so_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a\nreturn of NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when in fact no locks are held.  This is\nclearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can cause\nincorrect behaviour.\n\nIf RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is still\nprocessing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that request\nwas received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsd\nthread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) to\nthe lock owner that causes nfsd4_release_lockowner() to return an\nincorrect error.\n\nThe Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD error because it\nnever sends NFS4_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so\nit knows that the error is impossible.  It assumes the lock owner was in\nfact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in\nsome later locking request.\n\nWhen it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASE\nfailed, it will naturally use a lock_seqid of zero.  However the server,\nwhich didn't release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock_seqid and\nso will respond with NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID.\n\nSo clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testing\nso_count allows.\n\nThe test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn't mean anything.\n\nso_count is the sum of three different counts.\n1/ the set of states listed on so_stateids\n2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states\n3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks.\n\nWhen it is tested against '2' it is clear that one of these is the\ntransient reference obtained by find_lockowner_str_locked().  It is not\nclear what the other one is expected to be.\n\nIn practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one state\non so_stateids.  If there were more, this would fail.\n\nIn my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is called.\nIn one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE_LOCKOWNER.  That results in\nall the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded\n(it is removed when there are no more references which usually happens\nwhen the lock state is discarded).  When nfsd4_release_lockowner() finds\nthat the lock owner doesn't exist, it returns success.\n\nThe other case shows an so_count of '2' and precisely one state listed\nin so_stateid.  It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lock\nowner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so this\ntest on '2' is safe.  For another client it might not be safe.\n\nSo this patch changes check_for_locks() to use the (newish)\nfind_any_file_locked() so that it doesn't take a reference on the\nnfs4_file and so never calls nfsd_file_put(), and so never sleeps.  With\nthis check is it safe to restore the use of check_for_locks() rather\nthan testing so_count against the mysterious '2'."

The stack\nthen continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for\nthis driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the\n'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the\nclassifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a\n'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.\n\nHowever, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the\nunderlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when\na qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be\nreproduced using [2].\n\nFix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack\ninvoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.\nImplement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain\ntemplates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'\ncommand based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a\nfilter block or being unbound from one.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which\nreordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()\nin __tcf_block_put().

We need to check /proc/net/protocol\nto notice the unfreed socket.\n\n[0]:\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2863 at net/unix/garbage.c:345 __unix_gc+0xc74/0xe80 net/unix/garbage.c:345\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 2863 Comm: kworker/u4:11 Not tainted 6.8.0-rc1-syzkaller-00583-g1701940b1a02 #0\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 01/25/2024\nWorkqueue: events_unbound __unix_gc\nRIP: 0010:__unix_gc+0xc74/0xe80 net/unix/garbage.c:345\nCode: 8b 5c 24 50 e9 86 f8 ff ff e8 f8 e4 22 f8 31 d2 48 c7 c6 30 6a 69 89 4c 89 ef e8 97 ef ff ff e9 80 f9 ff ff e8 dd e4 22 f8 90 <0f> 0b 90 e9 7b fd ff ff 48 89 df e8 5c e7 7c f8 e9 d3 f8 ff ff e8\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000b03fba0 EFLAGS: 00010293\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffc9000b03fc10 RCX: ffffffff816c493e\nRDX: ffff88802c02d940 RSI: ffffffff896982f3 RDI: ffffc9000b03fb30\nRBP: ffffc9000b03fce0 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: fffff52001607f66\nR10: 0000000000000003 R11: 0000000000000002 R12: dffffc0000000000\nR13: ffffc9000b03fc10 R14: ffffc9000b03fc10 R15: 0000000000000001\nFS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880b9400000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00005559c8677a60 CR3: 000000000d57a000 CR4: 00000000003506f0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n process_one_work+0x889/0x15e0 kernel/workqueue.c:2633\n process_scheduled_works kernel/workqueue.c:2706 [inline]\n worker_thread+0x8b9/0x12a0 kernel/workqueue.c:2787\n kthread+0x2c6/0x3b0 kernel/kthread.c:388\n ret_from_fork+0x45/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:242\n </TASK>"

But, the async_write\nflag is now used as a marker by commit 7f42ec394156 (\"nilfs2: fix issue\nwith race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks\") as\na means of resolving double list insertion of dirty blocks in\nnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers() and the\nresulting crash.\n\nThis modification is safe as long as it is used for file data and b-tree\nnode blocks where the page caches are independent.  However, it was\nirrelevant and redundant to also introduce async_write for segment summary\nand super root blocks that share buffers with the backing device.  This\nled to the possibility that the BUG_ON check in end_buffer_async_write\nwould fail as described above, if independent writebacks of the backing\ndevice occurred in parallel.\n\nThe use of async_write for segment summary buffers has already been\nremoved in a previous change.\n\nFix this issue by removing the manipulation of the async_write flag for\nthe remaining super root block buffer."

Both\nare called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,\nhowever, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.\n\nThis opens multiple races:\n- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event\n  channel:\n\n  CPU0                        CPU1\n  shutdown_pirq {\n    xen_evtchn_close(e)\n                              __startup_pirq {\n                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq\n                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e\n                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)\n                              }\n    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {\n      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)\n    }\n  }\n\n  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel\n  number.\n  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).\n\n- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because\n  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the\n  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In\n  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can\n  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.\n\nThe fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the event\nchannel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it's\npotential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.\nThis is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the event\nchannel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.\n\nOn a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (\"xen/events: modify internal\n[un]bind interfaces\"), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMe\ndevices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irq\nis called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.\nWith many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race during\nboot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq and\nstartup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.\n\n  ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  blkfront: xvda: barrier or flush: disabled; persistent grants: enabled; indirect descriptors: enabled; bounce buffer: enabled\n  kernel BUG at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:499!\n  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI\n  CPU: 44 PID: 375 Comm: kworker/u257:23 Not tainted 5.10.201-191.748.amzn2.x86_64 #1\n  Hardware name: Xen HVM domU, BIOS 4.11.amazon 08/24/2006\n  Workqueue: nvme-reset-wq nvme_reset_work\n  RIP: 0010:bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0\n  Code: 5d 41 5e c3 cc cc cc cc 44 89 f7 e8 2b 55 ad ff 49 89 c5 48 85 c0 0f 84 64 ff ff ff 4c 8b 68 30 41 83 fe ff 0f 85 60 ff ff ff <0f> 0b 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 0f 1f 44 00 00\n  RSP: 0000:ffffc9000d533b08 EFLAGS: 00010046\n  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000006\n  RDX: 0000000000000028 RSI: 00000000ffffffff RDI: 00000000ffffffff\n  RBP: ffff888107419680 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffffff82d72b00\n  R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 00000000000001ed\n  R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00000000ffffffff R15: 0000000000000002\n  FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88bc8b500000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000002610001 CR4: 00000000001706e0\n  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n  Call Trace:\n   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9\n   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9\n   ? set_affinity_irq+0xdc/0x1c0\n   ? __die_body.cold+0x8/0xd\n   ? die+0x2b/0x50\n   ? do_trap+0x90/0x110\n   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0\n   ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80\n   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0\n   ? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70\n   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0\n   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x12/0x20\n   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0x\n---truncated---"

When negotiated write size is not a\nmultiple of 4096 the netfs code can skip the end of the final\npage when doing large sequential writes, causing data corruption.\n\nThis section of code is being rewritten/removed due to a large\nnetfs change, but until that point (ie for the 6.3 kernel until now)\nwe can not support non-standard maximum write sizes.\n\nAdd a warning if a user specifies a wsize on mount that is not\na multiple of 4096 (and round down), also add a change where we\nround down the maximum write size if the server negotiates a value\nthat is not a multiple of 4096 (we also have to check to make sure that\nwe do not round it down to zero)."

If the compiler choose another\nregister, the fault handler will nevertheless store -EFAULT into %r29 and thus\ntrash whatever this register is used for.\nLooking at the assembly I found that this happens sometimes in emulate_ldd().\n\nTo solve the issue, the easiest solution would be if it somehow is\npossible to tell the fault handler which register is used to hold the error\ncode. Using %0 or %1 in the inline assembly is not posssible as it will show\nup as e.g. %r29 (with the \"%r\" prefix), which the GNU assembler can not\nconvert to an integer.\n\nThis patch takes another, better and more flexible approach:\nWe extend the __ex_table (which is out of the execution path) by one 32-word.\nIn this word we tell the compiler to insert the assembler instruction\n\"or %r0,%r0,%reg\", where %reg references the register which the compiler\nchoosed for the error return code.\nIn case of an access failure, the fault handler finds the __ex_table entry and\ncan examine the opcode. The used register is encoded in the lowest 5 bits, and\nthe fault handler can then store -EFAULT into this register.\n\nSince we extend the __ex_table to 3 words we can't use the BUILDTIME_TABLE_SORT\nconfig option any longer."

If the tasklet callback frees\nthe structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may\nfree it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.\n\nThe commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but\nit is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].\nThere is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory\nwith every tasklet-processed bio.\n\nThere will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They\nwill have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory\ncorruption problem.\n\nBut we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be\nbackported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that\ndisables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity.

And the issue is that lan966x can have ports that are\nNULL pointer as they are not probed. So then iterating over these ports\nit would just crash as they are NULL pointers.\nThe fix consists in actually checking for NULL pointers before accessing\nsomething from the ports.

Otherwise, an unconnected\nsocket could illegally occupy an ehash entry.\n\nNote that we do not put tw back into ehash because sk might have\nalready responded to a packet for tw and it would be better to free\ntw earlier under such memory presure.\n\n[0]:\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 350830 at net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1193 inet_csk_destroy_sock (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1193)\nModules linked in:\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:inet_csk_destroy_sock (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1193)\nCode: 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e e9 2d 4a 3d fd e8 28 4a 3d fd 48 89 ef e8 f0 cd 7d ff 5b 5d 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e e9 13 4a 3d fd e8 0e 4a 3d fd <0f> 0b e9 61 fe ff ff e8 02 4a 3d fd 4c 89 e7 be 03 00 00 00 e8 05\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000b21fd38 EFLAGS: 00010293\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000009e78 RCX: ffffffff840bae40\nRDX: ffff88806e46c600 RSI: ffffffff840bb012 RDI: ffff88811755cca8\nRBP: ffff88811755c880 R08: 0000000000000003 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000009e78 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ffff88811755c8e0\nR13: ffff88811755c892 R14: ffff88811755c918 R15: 0000000000000000\nFS:  00007f03e5243800(0000) GS:ffff88811ae00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 0000001b32f21000 CR3: 0000000112ffe001 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\nPKRU: 55555554\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? inet_csk_destroy_sock (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1193)\n dccp_close (net/dccp/proto.c:1078)\n inet_release (net/ipv4/af_inet.c:434)\n __sock_release (net/socket.c:660)\n sock_close (net/socket.c:1423)\n __fput (fs/file_table.c:377)\n __fput_sync (fs/file_table.c:462)\n __x64_sys_close (fs/open.c:1557 fs/open.c:1539 fs/open.c:1539)\n do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83)\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:129)\nRIP: 0033:0x7f03e53852bb\nCode: 03 00 00 00 0f 05 48 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 41 c3 48 83 ec 18 89 7c 24 0c e8 43 c9 f5 ff 8b 7c 24 0c 41 89 c0 b8 03 00 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 35 44 89 c7 89 44 24 0c e8 a1 c9 f5 ff 8b 44\nRSP: 002b:00000000005dfba0 EFLAGS: 00000293 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000003\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000004 RCX: 00007f03e53852bb\nRDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0000000000000002 RDI: 0000000000000003\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 000000000000167c\nR10: 0000000008a79680 R11: 0000000000000293 R12: 00007f03e4e43000\nR13: 00007f03e4e43170 R14: 00007f03e4e43178 R15: 00007f03e4e43170\n </TASK>\n\n[1]:\nFAULT_INJECTION: forcing a failure.\nname failslab, interval 1, probability 0, space 0, times 0\nCPU: 0 PID: 350833 Comm: syz-executor.1 Not tainted 6.7.0-12272-g2121c43f88f5 #9\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:107 (discriminator 1))\n should_fail_ex (lib/fault-inject.c:52 lib/fault-inject.c:153)\n should_failslab (mm/slub.c:3748)\n kmem_cache_alloc (mm/slub.c:3763 mm/slub.c:3842 mm/slub.c:3867)\n inet_bind2_bucket_create \n---truncated---"

For the SR-IOV\ncase, there is no \"ibm,dma-window\". The original commit: b1fc44eaa9ba,\nfixes the path where memory is pre-mapped (direct mapped) to the DDW.\nWhen TCEs are direct mapped, there is no need to initialize IOMMU\ntables.\n\niommu_table_setparms_lpar() only considers \"ibm,dma-window\" property\nwhen initiallizing IOMMU table. In the scenario where TCEs are\ndynamically allocated for SR-IOV, newly created IOMMU table is not\ninitialized. Later, when the device driver tries to enter TCEs for the\nSR-IOV device, NULL pointer execption is thrown from iommu_area_alloc().\n\nThe fix is to initialize the IOMMU table with DDW property stored in the\nFDT. There are 2 points to remember:\n\n\t1. For the dedicated adapter, kdump kernel would encounter both\n\t   default and DDW in FDT. In this case, DDW property is used to\n\t   initialize the IOMMU table.\n\n\t2. A DDW could be direct or dynamic mapped. kdump kernel would\n\t   initialize IOMMU table and mark the existing DDW as\n\t   \"dynamic\". This works fine since, at the time of table\n\t   initialization, iommu_table_clear() makes some space in the\n\t   DDW, for some predefined number of TCEs which are needed for\n\t   kdump to succeed."
